Project Description

This project will explore how pricing differs across Airbnbs and the influences it has on demand. We will also explore the seasonal pattern of airbnb prices in New York City and the effects it has on travel. As an example, in New York City, Airbnb prices across different neighbourhood groups such as Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, and the Bronx might differ. We can look at how pricing varies across these different neighbourhood groups in terms of the number of the listings and property type available. 

The key element of the project is the use of Airbnbâ€™s data, providing access to measures such as prices, number of listings, property type, etc.  in New York. 

Key Questions: 
1. What causes the different pricing across neighbourhood groups?
2. How do prices affect demand for Airbnbs in New York?
3. How do holidays and seasonality affect pricing for Airbnbs in New York?
