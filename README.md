Project Description

This project will explore how pricing differs across Airbnbs and the influences it has on demand. We will also explore the seasonal pattern of airbnb prices in New York City and the effects it has on travel. As an example, in New York City, Airbnb prices across different neighbourhood groups such as Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, and the Bronx might differ. We can look at how pricing varies across these different neighbourhood groups in terms of the number of the listings and property type available. 

The key element of the project is the use of Airbnbâ€™s data, providing access to measures such as prices, number of listings, property type, etc.  in New York. Detailed of this dataset are described below in the data report. 

There will be three different sections in this project: 
##### 1. Basic Data Analysis

This section will have different summary statistics describing the number of listings and property type in each neighbourhood group.

##### 2. Pricing Effect on Demand for Airbnbs in New York City

This section will explore how prices differ across different neighbourhood groups and discover what factors prices are dependent on. We will have visualizations such as a map to indicate where entire apartments/homes are most prevalent. There will be a bar chart illustrating the average prices in each neighbourhood. By analyzing the number of listings and prices per neighbourhood, we can find out which neighbourhood is the most optimal. 

##### 3. Seasonal Pattern of Prices 

The last will explore how prices vary across different seasons. We plan to have visualizations showing how prices change over the year and provide explanations as to why. For example, airbnb prices during the holidays might be more expensive than during non-holidays.
